# Book Review Sentiment Analysis Project

In this project, I created a supervised logistic-regression  model to predict the sentiment of a book review, classifying each as either positive or negative. The input data was processed as the text was vectorized using Word2Vec in order to extract its sentiment, and the model was tuned on a variety of hyperparameters. This project was completed in Python and has a 60% accuracy rate
