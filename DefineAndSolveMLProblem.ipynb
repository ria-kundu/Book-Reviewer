This is a binary classification problem, since there are only two discrete classes or categories that an unlabeled example could have: true or false for being positive (ie positive or negative sentiment). Since the dataset only contains two columns, I will use the 'review' column as my only feature, which means that I will not be able to perform feature selection and see what features are the most important as I would for other models. This is an example of a superised learning problem since my datapoints are already labeled as having a positive or negative sentiment already.\n",

In addition, an author could also use this model to see if one of their books is doing well or not to see if they maybe want to capitalize on a text's popularity to make a sequel or invest more money in increasing marketing for it."

I will use a logistic regression model in order to predict the review as being positive or negative because that was the approach that previous modules used and because logistic regression models are used for binary classification problems, which this is (because the label being predicted is either positive or negative). I plan to first see how my model performs with the default parameters, and then I plan to optimize it by testing it with different threshold values, analzying its precision and recall and finding an optimal balance between those metrics in order to improve my model and make it generalize well to new data."

    "<b> Analysis: </b> Since I was using logistic regression for a binary classification problem, to tune my model and improve its performance, I tested out nine different threshold values for my model in order tofind which one led to the best accuracy and area under the roc curve score. I used a few different metrics that we used in the modules to compare the performance of the model under the different threshold values, and found that as the threshold increased, recall generally decreased as did the f1 score. The precision plateued, increased, and then generally decreased as the threshold increased, reaching a maximum value when the threshold was 0.6 and obtaining a minimum value when the threshold was 0.9. Since the f1 score represents a balance between precision and recall, the threshold with the highest f1 score is likely the best to optimize the model, which would be 0.3 according to the code cell above. Precision and Recall were important metrics to be used for this specific problem because they address the issue of a false positive rate, which is important in binary classification problems, especially for sentiment analysis because a balance of these two metrics ensures that the ratio of positive to negative predictions my model makes is fair, and isn't biased in a certain direction even though my dataset does not contain a class imbalance.\n",

    "Overall, after finding a threshold value that did optimize the precision recall balance of my model, I noticed that my AUC score did increase (also it was by a small amount), but my model's performance was optimized. "
